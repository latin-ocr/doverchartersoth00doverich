DovER CHARTERS 23

X 1.
5 May 1285.

Eowmu), by the grace of God, etc„ to his beloved, etc.
As we have learnt from the complaint of our Barons of
Faversham that you and your bailiffs there are grievously
distraining the said Barons for the performance of services
not due to you, and, contrary to a certain agreement made
between you and them, molest and in many ways wrongfully
harass them to the great expense and burden of the said Barons:
We, not wishing to injure the said Barons in this matter,
command you, as we have formerly commanded you, to
desist, and cause your bailiffs there to desist, from henceforth
levying distraints of this sort and undue burdens on the
aforesaid Barons against the agreement aforesaid3 and that
you observe the aforesaid agreement according to its tenour
so far as shall be just, in accordance with the tenour of the
other our mandate which you have received in that behalf‚
so that further complaint on that account may not reach us,
and cause us to aid them in this matter by the remedy of
further law ; οι· that you show cause to us why you should
not perform the premises.

Witness myself, at Westminster, the fifth day of May
in the thirteenth year of our reign.
