X 1 1 1.
5 August 1285-

Eowmzo, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of
Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine, to his beloved servant in
Christ, the Abbot of Faversham—Greeting. Forasmuch as
we have learnt from the complaint of our Barons of Favers-
ham that you and your bailiffs of Faversham grievously
distrain our Barons for the performance to you of undue
and unaccustomed services, and that you, contrary to a
certain composition formerly entered into between you and
them, frequently vex and unjustly oppress them to the
grievous and weighty hurt of these Barons : We, unwilling
that you should injure these Barons on this behalf, com-
mand you, as we have often commanded, firmly enjoining
you, that you entirely desist henceforth from levying
exactions and undue distraints of this kind on the afore-
said BaronS, and cause your bailiffs to desist; observing
the said agreement according to the tenor thereos, as shall
be just, according to the tenor of our other commands which
on that behalf you have received: and that you cease the
distraint made upon thern on the aforesaid plea without
delay, so that a second complaint on that account shall not
again reach us 3 or that you yourselves be before us wherever
we may then be in England within 15 days from the feast of
Saint Michael to answer to the said Barons for the unjust
exactions and distraints aforesaid, and (to answer) to us
wherefore you have delayed carrying out our frequent
mandates directed to you on that behalf : And you have
there this writ.

Witness myself, at Wolvemere, the fifth day of August
in the thirteenth year of our reign.
