the aforesaid contributions ; and that the money arising
from those contributions shall be deposited in a certain
Common Chest in the Church of Saint Martin of Dover,
under the custody of two or three honest and legal men of
the port aforesaid, owners of passenger ships and boats of
this kind, to be elected by owners of ships and boats of this
kind, and under the seals of other two or three honest and
legal men from the rest of the Community aforesaid, elected
for them in a similar manner for this purpose : to be reserved

letters patent.
