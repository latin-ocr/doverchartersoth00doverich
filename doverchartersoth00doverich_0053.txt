DOVER CHARTERS 21

X.
5 May 1285.

Eumne, by the grace of God, etc.‚ to his belm-ed, etc.
We have learnt from the complaint of our Barons of
F aversham that you, for your part, ought, in accordance
with a certain composition formerly made between you and
them, to find one man, at your own cost‚ to guard our
prison there, together with a certain other man to be found
for this purpose by the said Baron5‚ to the grievous hurt of
the said Barons, and contrary to the agreement aforesaid,
wrongfully refuse to find, as you formerly found, any man
for this purpose. We, considering that for lack of guard of
this kind danger may be likely to accrue to us in the future,
command you, as we have before commanded you, that you
cause the aforesaid man to be provided to guard the afore-
said prison on your behalf, as you ought, and have been
accustomed, to do according to the aforesaid agreement, and
according to the tenor of the other our mandate formerly
addressed to you in this behalf, so that we need not deser-
vedly punish your fault in this matter; or that you show
cause before us why you ought not to do so.

Witness myself, at westminster, the fifth day of May in
the thirteenth year of our reign.
