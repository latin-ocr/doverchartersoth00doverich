PREFACE

Tun various documents contained in this volume,
with the exception of those included in the Appendices,
have been transcribed from the originals in the
possession of the Corporation of Dover. They cover
the period embraced between the years 1227 and 1569.
The large majority of them, as is natural, are of purely
local interest, but there are some which will be found
to possess historical importance‚ especially with reference
to the Cinque PortS. The document numbered XXVI.
is, so far as Ι know, the earliest record of the ancient
Court of Shepway, and affords full information as to its
constitution, jurisdiction, and methods of procedure.
The manuscript consists of a double folio, and is
evidently the remains of the original Quaternus kept
by the Clerk of the Court. It unfortunately throws
no light upon the vexed question as to the locality in
which the Court was held. The oath of allegiance to
Henry VIII. contained in XCIX. is published in full,
Ι believe, for the first time. The various deeds have
been printed in chronological order, but have been
arranged under suitable headings in the Contents
columns; and, for the convenience of those who may
at any time wish to consult the originaIS‚ the reference
to the Corporation Archives is in every case given in
square brackets at the end of each document. One
Charter of the reign of Edward IV. has been omitted;
