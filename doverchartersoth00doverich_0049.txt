DOVER CHARTERS 17

vl11.
4 May 1282.

Tun ch to his beloved and faithful Stephen de Pencester,
Constable of his Castle of Dover and Warden of the
Cinque Ports—Greeting. As we have learnt from the
complaint of our Barons of Faversham that [Oswald] Abbot
· of the same place, ought, by a certain composition, formerly
made between himself and those Barons, to find one man, at
his own cost, to guard our prison there, together with a
certain other man to be found for this purpose by the said
Barons: and although the same Abbot should have found,
according to the said composition, the aforesaid man to
guard the aforesaid prison, he nevertheless now wrongfully
refuses to do this. We, considering that for lack of guard
of this kind danger will be likely to accrue in the future,
command you [that you make inquisition into the plaint] of
the Barons aforesaid3 if you find it to be thus you will
cause the aforesaid Abbot to find the man aforesaid for the
custody of that prison as he ought, and was wont‚ to do in
times past, by the aforesaid agreement.

Witness myself, at Gloucester, the fourth day of May in
the tenth year of our reign.
