V 1 1.
5 February 1280.

Know all men that I, Thomas Fitz-Gabriel, have remitted‚
and entirely for me and my heirs for ever quit-claimed
to God and the Hospita} of the blessed Mary at Dover,
and the Brethren of the same place, the whole right
and claim which Ι had in one half acre of land with its
appurtenances, in the tenure of the said Brethren, in the
village of River: which half acre, indeed, lies lengthwise
between the land of John le Neue towards the north, and
the land of Dionisius of Guston towards the south, and
abuts westward on the land of William at Vesie, and to the
east on the land of Dionisius at Bernes‚ to have and hold
the aforesaid half acre of land with its appurtenances to the
said Brethren and their successors for ever ; so that, to wit,
neither I, Thomas, nor my heirs shall either be, or ought to
be, able to exact or challenge in any way any right or claim
in the aforesaid half acre of land with its appurtenances for
ever : moreover, for this remissiori and quit—claim the afore-
said Brethren have given me forty shillings sterling in hand.

In testimony whereof I have confirmed this writing with

the muniment of my seal.
