PREFACE xvii

which their importance and utility to the State began
to decay, and that when we speak of Dover in the
days of King John, we are dealing with a town that had
played an important part in the nation’s affairs for a
considerable period. lt was no new burgh with its
customs to be formed, but an ancient Vill with its
history behind it. The important aid rendered to
William Ι. by the vessels of the south-eastern ports is
a proof of their power and vitality even in those early
dayS, and it would be an anachronism to imagine that
in 1203 they were just formulating some system of
local government. They were far more likely engaged
in defending their ancient liberties from change and
encroachment. All this leads me to think that the
absence of the name of some chief civic official in this
Charter is highly remarkable, especially as in all sub-
sequent Court documents the Mayor and Bailiff are
invariably found as witnesses.

The first time the title of Mayor occurs in The
Dover Charters is in 1257 (page 9), and the first writ
addressed to the “Mayors and Bailiffs of the Cinque
Ports” is dated August 30, 1256 (Rot. Pal„ 40 Henry
III.). We may therefore assume with some confidence
that the title was not used until about this period.
About the same date the Prepositus disappears and the
King’s representative is known as the Bailiff. The Index
gives a list of a large number of these civic officers, but
by no means exhausts the information obtainable on this
point. I have been able to compile from various
sources a roll of the Mayors of Dover from the year
1363, which, with the exception of six years only, is
complete to the present'day. There are also some
twenty years accounted for between 12 57 and 1363,
