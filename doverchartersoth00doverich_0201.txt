Know all men that l, Cecilia‚ relict of Alexander Polton,
of Dover, in my widowhood have remitted, released, and
altogether quit-claimed for ever for me and my executors, to
Agnes Poston, my daughter, the whole of my right and
claim of right which Ι had, shall have, or in any way shall in
future be able to have, in a tenement or stable situated
within the Liberty of the Port of Dover in Mankyn Ward,
between the King's highway to the south-east, and the land
of Robert Boydin to the south-west, and the land of Thomas
Crouche to the north-west, and between the tenement of
John Petham to the north-east : so that neither Ι, the afore-
named Cecilia, nor anyone else in my name, shall in future
be able to claim or challenge henceforward in the aforesaid
tenement or stable with its appurtenance8‚ or in any part of
it, any right of property or claim, but that by these presents
we are shut out for ever from every action of right.

In witness whereof Ι have affixed my seal to this present.

Given at Dover on the last day of May in the thirteenth
year of the reign of King Henry‚ the fourth of England
after the conquest.
