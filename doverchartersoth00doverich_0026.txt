xviii PREFACE

and although there is but small hope of adding many
other names to the list, it is doubtful whether any other
town in England can produce a fuller authentic record.

There are three words which occur in different
documents which seem to require some explanation—
Skomerfare on page 873 Lovecopfry on page 1793 and
Utvietlzis on page 264. Skomerfare occurs in Gower's
Confessio Amantis, and in Halliwell's Dictionary is de-
scribed as meaning piracy. The derivation is given
as from escumerie, which certainly means piracy. This
explanation is not altogether satisfactory, for Skomerfare
is evidently a compound word, and cannot be derived
from escumerie alone. In the Dover Chamberlains'
Accounts the tolls levied on various imports are invariable
called “fare,’' e.g., “Hokfare‚“ “Herringfare,’‘ “Sprot-
fare,'’ ete., and Skomerfare must accordingly be a toll
levied on “Skomer.” The word occurs occasionally in
the accounts, and it will not be out of place to quote one
or two instances of its use.

out of pirate vessels, or, what is more probable, the
proportion of profit which each mariner obtained as his
share of the plunder. Ι am inclined to think the latter is
the right local interpretation of the word, for the Warden,
as the Admiral of the Cinque PortS, always claimed at

least a share in the goods of pirates, The patent of
Henry Brook, Eighth Lord Cobham, as Warden of the
