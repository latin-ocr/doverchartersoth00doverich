that the chief civic officer was a Doyen “elected by the
inhabitants of the Vill, or by the more worthy of
them, to whom belonged the right of making ad-
jornamenta and taking bail.” This view would account
for the teste of Simon the Dean in the Charter in
question, but having submitted it to some whose verdict
would probably be regarded as final, and having been
told that it is “fanciful '’ and “ untenable,’' I can do no
more than record it as my humble contribution to the
solution of a difficult question. Two facts are patent——
in the days of the Conqueror Dover burgesses possessed
certain privileges 3 when, some two hundred years later,
its history begins to rise from obscurity‚ we find it with
a well-established system of sels-government. The
Mayor and Jurats exercise full legal and civic authority
over the freemen, the king’s officer, first a prepositus,
and then a Bailiff, over the “foreigner,‘' or “alien '‘
resident in the Vill. To what date are we to assign
the origin of this form of government? Was it a
development since the Conquest‚ or was it the survival
of a set of customs anterior to the death of Harold?
The probabilities‚ in my opinion, are that the latter is

formed their custumal more from their neighbours
across the Channel than from inland sources, It must
always be remembered in dealing with the early history
of Dover, and of the other Cinque Ports, that the end
of the Angevin dynasty roughly marks the period at
