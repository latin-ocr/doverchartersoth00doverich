DOVER CHARTERS 19

1 X.
4 May 1282.

Eumne, by the grace of God, King of England‚ Lord of
lreland, and Duke of Aquitaine, to his beloved servant in
Christ, the Abbot of Faversham—Greeting. As we have
learnt from the complaint of our Barons of F aversham
that, as you ought, in accordance with a certain composition
formerly made between you and them, to find for your part
one man, at your own eost, to guard our prison there, to-
ether with a certain other man to be found for this purpose
gy the said Barons, to the grievous hurt of the said Barons,
and contrary to the aforesaid agreement, you wrongfully
refuse to find, as you formerly found, any man for this pur-
pose: We, considering that for lack of guard of this kind
danger might be likely to accrue in the future, command you
that you cause to be provided the aforesaid man to guard
that prison on your behalf, as you ought, and have been
accustomed‚ to do according to the aforesaid agreement,
so that we need not deservedly punish your fault in this
matter.
Witness myself, at Gloucester‚ the fourth day of May in
the tenth year of our reign.
