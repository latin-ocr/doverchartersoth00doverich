Eowmm, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of
Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine, to all to whom these pre-
sent letters may come—Greeting. We have inspected our
charter of confirmation which we lately made, under the seal
which we were then using, to the Barons of our Cinque
Ports in these words t Edward, by the grace of God, King of
England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine, to all to
whom these present letters may come—Greeting. We have
inspected the letters patent which *King Edward of illustrious
memory, formerly King of England, our grandfather, made in
these words.

“ Edward, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord
of Ireland and Duke of Aquitaine, to all to whom the present
letters may come—Greeting. Considering that our Navy of
the Cinque Ports cannot be kept up without great outlay
and expense ; lest that Navy languish or perish in the future,
we have granted for Us and our heirs that all they of the
Cinque Ports aforesaid, and any others whatsoever avowing
themselves to be of the Liberty of the same, and on that
account willing to enjoy them, shall subscribe, to wit, every
one of them according to their power, to the performance of
the Service due to Us or our heirs with their ships whenever
they shall have it in command from us or our heirs. In
testimony whereof we have caused these our letters to be
made patent. Witness myself at Saint Albans the 28 day of
April in the 26th year of our reign.'‘ [1298]

We therefore, holding as ratified and gratified the aforesaid
grant, have granted and confirmed it, for us and our heirs, as the
aforesaid letters reasonably testify; but because heretofore various
dissensions have arisen over the general words aforesaid contained
in the aforesaid letters, to wit, that each one of them shall sub-
scribe according to their power, We, in order that the Barons os
the aforesaid Ports may be the better able to perform the aforesaid

* Edward I .
