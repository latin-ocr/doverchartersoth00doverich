and on the lands, tenements and chattels that he may possess
in the said town, and shall deliver the said 100 shillings to
the Warden of the Cinque Ports at once, without delay,
within fifteen days after that offence committed. And if
the said Bailiff make default or be found negligent in
enforcing the levy of the 100 shillings as aforesaid, then it

Companions of the “fferschip” that four good and loyal

collect and preserve to the common benefit of the whole
Company all the services and doles, small and great, as they
arise‚ and that no money shall be delivered by the said
Wardens to any of the Company except in payment of his

heirs, and for all that shall come after that, these ordinances
and every article of these ordinances as is above written be
firm and established for ever, we have caused to be made
