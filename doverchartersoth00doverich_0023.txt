carte hujus scriptor), representing the Castle; and the
Prepositus and Clerk of Dover representing the Town.
In addition to these there are twenty—seven other names,
which are those of important townsmen and Castle
officials. It will at once be seen that there is a striking
omission, no Mayor of Dover appears among the
witnesseS, and what, to me, is more remarkable, a
“Simon the Dean'' signs before the Constable. The
question naturally ariseS, Was there a Mayor of Dover
at this period? Ι here made considerable research to
settle this point, but have merely obtained some negative
results, There is no record of the town having been let
to the Burgesses at fee ferm, and there is no reference
to Dover in this connection in Maddox‘s Firma Burgi
or the History of the Exclzequer. The Pipe Rolls show
a return for the ferm of Dover, but the ferm was paid
from the issues of the passage and not by the freemen.
In the reign of Henry ΙΙΙ. this ferm disappears altogether,
being, as I imagine, assigned to the Constable in part
payment of his salary (cf. Rot. Claus., R. Ser„ 13 Ed. I.‚
fol. 322, 324). In the absence of any positive informa-
tion of a later date, we are driven back to the Domesday
Book, which clearly proves that in the days of the
Confessor the Burgesses of Dover possessed certain
privileges which they held by a service of ships, and
that, moreover, they had a Gilhalla. It would be an
outrage to common sense to imagine that the Burgesses
had no presiding officer, they must have chosen some-
one, and he must also have been known by some title,
and my surmise is that he was called the “ Dean.’‘ My
study of the early documents connected with Dover
have led me to accept without hesitation Μι- Horace
